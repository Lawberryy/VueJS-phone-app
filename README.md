# VueJS Phone App project

## Description

This project made with VueJS aims to recreate part of the functionalities of the phone app of a smartphone.
There are 3 main pages:
- On the Journal page, you have your call history of the user with the contact's name or number, the date & time of the call.
- On the Contact page, you have the list of your contacts and a button to call them. You can also click on the "+" logo to have access to a form which allows you to add a new contact.
- On the Keyboard page, you can dial and call the number you want.

:construction: The project still needs to be improved on some features.
